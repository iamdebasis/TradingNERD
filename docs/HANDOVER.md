# tradingNerd hand-over

The state of the work, for whoever picks it up next, human or AI. Update it at every hand-over. The rules are in [../AGENTS.md](../AGENTS.md); the decisions and their reasons in [SPEC.md](SPEC.md).

**Last updated:** 26 October 2026, by the AI Lead Architect and Lead Delivery Engineer (Claude).

## 1. Where things stand

| | |
|---|---|
| Branch | `m7-us-stocks`; last commit `91b07ef` (M9e, A2, A6). `main` is at `a6fa4d7`, 4 commits behind; it moves only when the user says "merge" |
| Committed | M0–M8e (chart, intervals, watchlists, search, exchanges, feel, US stocks, several watchlists), M9a–M9e (CRYPTOCAP, formulas, Bitstamp, kept history, older market caps), A1, A2, A6 (accuracy steps) |
| Built, not committed | **M9f, each coin's older days:** built, tested, switched off in the charts. Its download runs on the user's gateway |
| Taken out | A3 (hiding unchecked coins), on the user's rule against hiding data |
| Not built | M7c (stock logos); A4 and A5 (overtaken by M9e and M9f) |

The milestone table is SPEC §8.

## 2. Under way: M9f, each coin's older days

The user said YES to steps 1–3: the ETH Zurich import, the Live Coin Watch download with its tests, and the accuracy test, stopping to report before anything on the charts changes. The design is SPEC §3 (rows of 26 October), §4.14 and §5.14.

| Step | State |
|---|---|
| 1. ETH Zurich's dataset | In place in `data/cryptocap/older-coins/`: `market_cap_all_daily.csv` and `close_price_all_daily.csv`, the same bytes as Zenodo's, placed by hand because Zenodo turns programs away. 1,211 coins ever in a day's top 200 |
| 2a. Reading Live Coin Watch's list | Running on the user's gateway: over 63,800 coins read by the evening of 26 October (100 a request), about 21,000 kept as candidates |
| 2b. Each candidate's months | Next, automatically: a request a coin, in groups most likely first, each group given up after 1,000 in a row outside a month's 250 largest. **First check how many requests it will need** (`data/cryptocap/older-coins/index.json`, `listed`; `lookAtGroups` in `olderCoins.ts`) and tell the user before it spends many |
| 2c. Every day of the chosen coins | Then, automatically: each coin among a month's 200 largest (stablecoins, the 60 largest), and each of CoinGecko's coins, 100 days a request. About 2–3 days in all at the free 10,000 requests a day; it waits at the day's end (00:00 UTC) and carries on after restarts |
| 3. The accuracy test | Ready, waiting for the download. See below |
| 4. In the charts | Needs the user's YES after the test. Turn the switch on by default and retire M9e's whole-market days for TOTAL, TOTAL2, TOTAL3 and BTC.D |
| 5. Commit | Needs its own YES |

**Watching it:** `GET http://127.0.0.1:5180/api/older-caps` → `coins` (`state`, `progress`, `message`), or the dialog "Older market caps (Live Coin Watch)…" in the watchlist's ⋯ menu. The key is saved in the app (`data/secrets.json`), so a plain `pnpm dev` is enough.

**The accuracy test** (`tools/accuracy/`):
1. `tools/accuracy/check.sh` starts a gateway of its own on 5191, on a copy of `data/` without `secrets.json`, with `CRYPTOCAP_OLDER_COINS=1`. It has no keys, so it downloads nothing.
2. It reads TradingView's TOTAL2/XRPUSD weekly chart off `docs/reference/tv-total2-xrpusd-1w-2026-10-26.png`, pixel column by pixel column.
3. It compares those columns with our weekly highs drawn into the same columns.

| What | Figures |
|---|---|
| The ruler, validated on our own last year | Median −0.2%; half the columns between −0.3% and +0.1% |
| **Pass mark** | Within ±3% in each year 2019–2024; no step at 7/8 February 2018 or at our first day; a bar every day |
| **Today, M9e (Live Coin Watch's whole market)** | 2018 +20.7%, 2019 +11.7%, 2020 +2.2%, 2021 +5.9%, 2022 +8.3%, 2023 +9.2%, 2024 +9.2%, 2025 +2.3% |
| 2017 | Can't pass: TradingView's own 2017 is smaller than Ethereum's market cap alone (+231%) |

If a year misses, report it with the reasons before changing anything. Likely causes:
- coins missed between monthly looks;
- Live Coin Watch's supply jumps;
- wrapped tokens let through.

## 3. Running and checking

- **Start:** `pnpm dev`, then open http://127.0.0.1:5173.
- **Keys,** each in its dialog: CoinGecko (coin logos and CRYPTOCAP), Alpaca (US stocks), Live Coin Watch (older market caps).
- **Before every delivery:** `pnpm verify`, then a read-only check against the running app (AGENTS.md).
- **Test counts on 26 October:**
  - core 336, chart 48, web 163;
  - gateway 511 (plus 66 that need the live internet);
  - browser 192;
  - lint and typecheck clean.
- **Known flaky test:** Bitstamp's "polls the live candle every 30 s" sometimes fails under load and passes on a rerun.

## 4. Security

Audited on 26 October against the code, the running app and all of git history ([SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md)): every point held.
- **Only providers:** nothing leaves the Mac but what the data providers need.
- **Keys:** owner-only and masked to the browser.
- **Network:** the servers can't be reached from other machines.
- **No telemetry,** and no remote to push to.
- **To do:** back up `data/` (encrypted, e.g. Time Machine), above all `data/cryptocap/anchors.json`, whose kept days can't be downloaded again.

## 5. Open items

The full list is SPEC §11; these are the ones that matter most.

- **Accuracy:**
  - Older years read a few percent high until M9f is switched on (§11, items 58–59).
  - About 24 coins' supply differs from TradingView's, and CoinGecko's figure is shown (item 50).
  - TradingView's own 2017 is incomplete.
- **Depth:**
  - Kraken gives the last 720 bars; its free downloadable OHLCVT files could give the rest (Phase 3).
  - OKX stops at its own cut-offs.
  - US stocks start in 2016 (item 60).
- **Waiting for the user's word:**
  - gold and silver for BTCUSD/XAUUSD and BTCUSD/SILVER;
  - TradingView-style self-widening watchlist columns (item 53);
  - a separate data folder for the browser tests' own gateway (item 57);
  - M7c stock logos.
- **Free limits that can change:** CoinGecko's 10,000 calls a month, Live Coin Watch's 10,000 requests a day. CoinDesk reportedly ended its free plan in 2026.

## 6. Next steps, in order

1. Size step 2b and tell the user how many requests it needs.
2. Let the download finish, then run `tools/accuracy/check.sh`.
3. Report the result year by year, then ask YES to switch M9f on in the charts.
4. Update SPEC (§5.14 status, §8, §11) and this file, then ask YES to commit.
5. Then the user's list: Phase 3 (Kraken's history files), and the open items above, each with its own plan and YES.
